Many of the tasks performed by mobile service robots today require navigation (approaching objects) and manipulation (interacting with the objects). Navigation & manipulation are often solved sequentially as separate tasks. Ideally, the robot can use the approaching motion for the manipulation task to improve the objectâ€™s perception as well as to pre-plan the manipulation for efficient execution. This PhD project is investigating how approaching motion can be used to optimize perception and planning to enable robust and efficient manipulation on mobile robots.
