<b>Abstract:</b>
This paper describes the system architecture for an autonomous interactive drink serving robot developed for use in public spaces and at social events. The proposed system design focuses on finding the balance between technological readiness and social readiness levels thus enabling a technology that can be deployed in real-world environments along with social acceptance. We describe different components required for designing such a system and discuss both their technical feasibility and social acceptance aspects. We also present a behavior tree based software architecture for integrating these components, which results in modular design and promotes their re-usability.
