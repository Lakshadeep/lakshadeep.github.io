In this paper, we present a method for proactive approaching of humans for human-robot cooperative tasks such as a robot serving beverages to people. The proposed method can deal robustly with the uncertainties in the robot’s perception while also ensuring socially acceptable behavior. We use multiple modalities in the form of the robot’s motion, body orientation, speech and gaze to proactively approach humans. Further, we present a behavior tree based control architecture to efficiently integrate these different modalities. The proposed method was successfully integrated and tested on a beverage serving robot. We present the findings of our experiments and discuss possible extensions to address limitations.
