I attended [Nordic Probabilistic AI Summer School](https://probabilistic.ai/) in Helsinki, Finland.

The primary emphasis of this school was on Probabilistic Machine Learning, with a focus on topics such as variational approximations, deep generative models, latent variable models, normalizing flows, neural ODEs, and probabilistic programming.
