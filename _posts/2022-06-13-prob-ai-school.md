I am in Helsinki, Finland to attend [Nordic Probabilistic AI Summer School](https://probabilistic.ai/). 

The school focuses on Probabilistic Machine Learning with a focus on variational approximations, deep generative models, latent variable models, normalizing flows, neural ODEs, probabilistic programming etc.
