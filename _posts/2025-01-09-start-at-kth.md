I moved to Stockholm, Sweden, to join the [Division of Robotics, Perception and Learning (RPL)](https://www.kth.se/is/rpl) at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en) as a postdoctoral researcher, where Iâ€™m working under the supervision of [Professor Danica Kragic](https://www.kth.se/profile/dani).
