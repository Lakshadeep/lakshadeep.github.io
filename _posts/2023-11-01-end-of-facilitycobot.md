The FacilityCobot project has officially concluded. This project marked my initial foray into the field of Mobile Manipulation. My PhD research was mostly funded throught this project. 

Our research throughout the FacilityCobot project were dedicated to enhancing the time efficiency of Mobile Manipulation while concurrently minimizing failures. Further insights into our research can be explored through the following links:
