I spent January 2023 at Middle East Technical University (METU) in Ankara, Turkey, as a visiting PhD student. During this period, I collaborated with Prof. Sinan Kalkan to address the challenge of optimizing the time-efficiency of Mobile Manipulation. 

Our focus was on identifying a suitable base pose and pre-grasp manipulator configuration to improve the time-efficiency of grasping on mobile robots.
