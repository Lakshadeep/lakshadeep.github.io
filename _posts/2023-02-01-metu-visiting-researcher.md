I spent January 2023 at Middle East Technical University (METU), Ankara, Turkey as a visiting researcher. 

I worked with Prof. Sinan Kalkan in investigating the problem of optimizing time-efficiency of mobile manipulation by adopting a suitable pre-grasp manipulator configuration while navigating towards the target object for grasping.
