Our research on pre-grasp approaching on mobile robots has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) Journal. 

This work was carried out in collaboration with Prof. Sinan Kalkan from Middle East Technical University (METU), Ankara, Turkey and my PhD supervisor Prof. Norbert Krüger.
