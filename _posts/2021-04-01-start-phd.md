I officially started my PhD, at SDU Robotics, Faculty of Engineering, University of Southern Denmark. 

My PhD will be mostly part of the [FacilityCobot](https://www.sdu.dk/en/om_sdu/fakulteterne/teknik/nyt_fra_det_tekniske_fakultet/nu-faar-kantinedamen-sin-egen-robothjaelper) project which will develop robots with sensor technology and artificial intelligence that can help out the cleaning staff.

I will investigate the use of approaching motion during the manipulation task for enabling smooth and efficient manipulation on mobile robots. Thus my PhD will develop novel methods for interplay between approaching motion (navigation) and manipulation.
