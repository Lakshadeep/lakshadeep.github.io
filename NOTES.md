<!-- <b>Learning Simultaneous Navigation and Manipulation on Mobile Robots using Curriculum with Intrinsic Rewards</b>

In mobile manipulation, navigation and manipulation are generally solved as subsequent disjoint tasks. Simultaneous navigation and manipulation is a challenging problem as (i) manipulation requires the prediction of robot base pose for grasping and (ii) the joint optimization of these two tasks often leads to sub-optimal solutions for individual tasks. In this work, we propose a novel curricular approach for simultaneous navigation and manipulation on mobile robots. Our proposed approach first trains a robot base pose prediction network while learning to navigate to the target object. Then it learns to simultaneously perform pre-grasp manipulator motion while navigating to the target object by providing intrinsic rewards based on the robot base pose prediction network. We show that, with our approach, a robot can learn simultaneous navigation and manipulation that provides significant time gains for task execution and results in more stable learning compared to available approaches.
