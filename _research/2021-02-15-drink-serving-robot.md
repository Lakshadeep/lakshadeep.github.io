We created an autonomous, interactive drink-serving robot designed for deployment in public spaces and social events. Our system design emphasized achieving a balance between technological and social readiness levels, ensuring a technology that seamlessly integrates into real-world environments while being socially accepted. 

This work was carried out in the context of the <b>SMOOTH (Seamless huMan-robot interactiOn fOr THe support of elderly people)</b> project funded by the <b>Innovation Fund Denmark</b> from 2017-2021.
