In this research, we explored the implementation of distributed agency on mobile care robots through the development of a prototype of the Plant Watering Robot (PWR). Our efforts were part of the broader scope of the <b>ReThiCare (Rethinking Care Robots)</b> project, funded by <b>Volkswagen Stiftung</b> from 2019 to 2022.
