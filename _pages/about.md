Hi, thanks for droping by. I am Lakshadeep. I like working with mobile robots. I work at the intersection of vision, motion, and interaction for mobile robots. I have recently submitted my PhD at [SDU Robotics](https://www.sdu.dk/en/forskning/sdurobotics), Faculty of Engineering, University of Southern Denmark. 

During my PhD, I focused on perception and planning for mobile manipulation. Specifically, I integrated observations from external cameras with the robot's camera for 6D pose estimation and uncertainty quantification for pre-grasp planning. I also worked on enabling computationally efficient online pre-grasp planning by learning to plan. Prior to my PhD, I worked on extending OpenStreetMap for indoor robot navigation and contributed to the research and development of social care robots and marine robots.
