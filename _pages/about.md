Hi, I am Lakshadeep. Currently, I am postdoctoral researcher in [Division of Robotics, Perception and Learning (RPL)](https://www.kth.se/is/rpl) at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en) supervised by [Professor Danica Kragic](https://www.kth.se/profile/dani). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of planning and perception for mobile robots. I aim to leverage advances in robot learning, probabilistic modeling, and topological representations to tackle these research challenges.

Previously, I completed my PhD at [SDU Robotics](https://www.sdu.dk/en/forskning/sdurobotics), Faculty of Engineering, University of Southern Denmark under the guidance of [Professor Norbert Krueger](https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/en/persons/norbert). During my PhD, I focused on perception and planning for mobile manipulation. Specifically, I integrated observations from external cameras with the robot's camera for 6D pose estimation and uncertainty quantification for pre-grasp planning. I also worked on enabling computationally efficient online pre-grasp planning by learning to plan. 

Prior to my PhD, I worked on extending OpenStreetMap for indoor robot navigation and contributed to the research and development of social care robots and marine robots.
