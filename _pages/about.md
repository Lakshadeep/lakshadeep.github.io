Hi, I am Lakshadeep. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Division of Robotics, Perception and Learning (RPL)](https://www.kth.se/is/rpl) at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/en) with [Professor Danica Kragic](https://www.kth.se/profile/dani). 

My research focuses on robot learning for mobile manipulation, using reinforcement learning and behavior cloning. I am particularly interested in
* using whole-body motion to improve perception and planning
* identifying suitable indoor scene representations for learning mobile manipulation tasks.
More details about my research can be found here.

Previously, I completed my PhD at [SDU Robotics](https://www.sdu.dk/en/forskning/sdurobotics), Faculty of Engineering, University of Southern Denmark with [Professor Norbert Krueger](https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/en/persons/norbert). During my PhD, I focused on perception and planning for mobile manipulation.
