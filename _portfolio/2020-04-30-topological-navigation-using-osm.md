We introduced a new modular approach for localization and navigation in large indoor environments using a semantic map. It exploits the knowledge in the semantic map to select and configure perception and motion control algorithms and effectively turns the localization and navigation task into a sequence of perception and control problems. A solution for each individual perception and control problem can be selected from a set of software components. Monitoring the assumptions and outputs of each component does not only allow to determine the transitions to new components in that sequence but also to be more robust and to determine the system performance.
